I am Vasu Bhardwaj. Iâ€™m an experienced product developer. I am comfortable with working on the backend, the frontend and DevOps, depending on the task at hand, with some experience in managing small teams.
<br/>
I completed my B.Tech in Software Engineering from Delhi Technological University. I thrive on caffeine and love to explore the coffee shops everywhere I go. 
<br/>
<br/>
This blog is a means for me to keep track of various things I'm learning on my journey in the tech world.
